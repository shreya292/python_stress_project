# Stress Testing Automation Project

## Project Overview

This project involves setting up a comprehensive stress testing framework using virtual machines and various tools for monitoring, logging, and automation. The primary objective is to evaluate system performance under different stress conditions and gather insights for optimization.

## Virtual Machines Setup

- Create three virtual machines:
  - `vm_0`: Running Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring.
  - `vm_1`: Hosting the Python stress testing script with Node Exporter and MySQLD Exporter.
  - `vm_2`: Running MySQL Server.

Ensure all VMs run a compatible Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu or CentOS).

## Menu-Based Python Script

Develop a Python script on `vm_1` with the following options for stress testing:

1. Press 1 for Memory Stress Testing
2. Press 2 for Disk Stress Testing
3. Press 3 for Network Stress Testing
4. Press 4 for CPU Stress Testing
5. Press 5 for MySQL Stress Testing

## Stress Testing Parameters

- Set stress testing parameters to 80% of total usage.
- If usage exceeds this threshold, an email notification will be sent.

## Version Control and CI/CD

- Host the Python script on GitHub.
- Set up Jenkins to automate the build process using webhooks.
- Use ngrok to expose the Jenkins server for webhook communication.
- Include a `Jenkinsfile` to define the build process.

## Configuration Management

- Use Ansible to automate the installation of required software on the VMs (Prometheus, Grafana, MySQL, exporters, etc.).
- Create Ansible playbooks to ensure consistent configurations across the VMs.

## Containerization

- Containerize the Python script using Docker.
- Use Kubernetes to deploy the containerized application, ensuring proper scaling and management.
- Create Kubernetes manifests (YAML files) for deployment and service configuration.

## Logging and Monitoring

- Implement logging in the Python script to capture output and errors.
- Configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from Node Exporter and MySQLD Exporter.
- Set up Grafana dashboards to visualize metrics in real-time.

## Email Notification Setup

- Integrate an email service (using Alertmanager) to handle email notifications when the stress threshold is exceeded.

## Log Analysis and Suggestions

- After stress testing, fetch logs generated by the Python script.
- Send these logs to the ChatGPT or Gemini API for analysis and suggestions.
- Integrate a mechanism to send the suggestions received from the API to a WhatsApp account using a service like Twilio or WhatsApp Business API.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Set up the virtual machines as described above.
3. Install the necessary software and dependencies.
4. Run the Ansible playbooks to configure the VMs.
5. Execute the Python script on `vm_1` to begin stress testing.
